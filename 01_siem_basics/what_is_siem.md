# What is SIEM?

## Definition

SIEM stands for **Security Information and Event Management**.  
It is a system that collects logs from multiple sources, processes them, and helps security teams detect, investigate, and respond to threats.

---

## Why SIEM is Needed

Modern infrastructures generate massive logs from:

- Servers and endpoints
- Firewalls and network devices
- Applications
- Windows Event Logs
- Linux system logs

Manually analyzing these logs is not practical.  
SIEM centralizes, parses, and analyzes them in one place.

## Core Functions of SIEM

1. Log Collection from multiple sources
2. Log Parsing and Normalization
3. Event Correlation
4. Alert Generation
5. Investigation and Search
6. Reporting and Dashboards

---

## How SIEM Works (High Level)

1. Logs are generated by devices and systems
2. Logs are forwarded to the SIEM platform
3. SIEM parses, indexes, and stores the logs
4. Alerts and correlations are created based on rules
5. Analysts investigate using the SIEM interface

## Relationship Between SOC and SIEM

**SOC (Security Operations Center)** is the team and process.  
**SIEM** is the primary technology used by the SOC.

> SOC uses SIEM to monitor, detect, and investigate security events.

Without SIEM, SOC cannot centrally monitor logs.  
Without SOC, SIEM alerts have no one to investigate them.

## Examples of SIEM Platforms

- Splunk Enterprise
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Elastic Security
- IBM QRadar

---

## Key Point

SIEM is not just a tool.  
It is a centralized system that combines **log management + security monitoring** for threat detection.

---

## Interview Line

SIEM is a centralized platform that collects, processes, and analyzes logs from multiple sources, enabling SOC teams to detect and respond to security threats.
